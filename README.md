 MARIA NUNEZ-RIVAS üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

 About me üë©üèª‚Äçüíª:  
 
 I'm passionate about software quality assurance and take pride in ensuring that every product I work on meets the highest standards of reliability and performance. I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas are shared, communication is open, and everyone works toward a common goal.

Beyond technical skills, I value integrity, respect, and thoughtful communication. I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute my QA expertise in a team that values not just productivity, but also a healthy, supportive work culture. A place where people are treated with respect, and where deep values and a strong sense of purpose guide the work we do.

Case Studies:

Case #1 : In one of my previous teams, there was a common misunderstanding around Agile story points. Despite using the Fibonacci scale, many team members and even some managers believed story points were directly tied to hours or time estimates.
With over 10 years of experience working in Agile environments, I understand that story points are actually a measure of effort and complexity, not time. They also take into account the individual's experience with a task so as a team member gains experience, the perceived effort (and point value) should decrease over time.
I noticed that one manager continued to assign points based on time estimates, even after I explained the concept and my own manager supported this explanation. Rather than creating tension or pushing the issue, I decided to share official Agile documentation via email that clearly explained the correct usage of story points.
A few days later, she thanked me for the information and adjusted her approach. This not only helped improve the team's velocity metrics but also reinforced a more accurate Agile practice within that team.
It was a great example of how clear communication and documentation can resolve misunderstandings without creating unnecessary conflict.

Case #2: As an Agile Lead, one of my key responsibilities was to prepare presentations and reports for senior management that included velocity reports, team performance metrics, and action plans to address challenges faced by teams struggling to meet their velocity targets.
To keep management informed, I regularly presented detailed reports that outlined the current team velocity, key performance indicators (KPIs), and specific challenges the teams were facing. I also recommended best practices, including the adoption of new tools and techniques, to improve team efficiency and quality. These actionable insights helped senior management understand the hurdles teams encountered, and the steps being taken to resolve them.
By working closely with management, I provided strategic advice on how Agile methodologies could be further optimized to better meet business goals. I also guided teams in managing dynamics and fostering an environment of continuous improvement. Through this collaboration, the teams were able to align their efforts with organizational priorities and successfully meet their velocity targets. As a result, we saw improvements in delivery timelines and product quality, which were key goals for the organization

Case #3: Around 2020, I was assigned to a team in the early stages of developing a new mobile app. The team had limited experience with mobile app development, but I had already worked on several mobile apps and had a solid understanding of the challenges and best practices.
As soon as I joined, I was appointed Scrum Master, where I quickly took the lead in helping the team get up to speed. Recognizing that they needed foundational knowledge and hands-on practice, I organized training sessions to familiarize them with the tools, frameworks, and mobile development concepts. I also helped them connect their devices to the software we were working on. Initially, we used physical devices for testing, but eventually transitioned to BrowserStack for device testing.
To foster a structured workflow, I set up daily stand-up meetings where the team could quickly share progress, blockers, and plans for the day. I also introduced sprint reviews and retrospectives, ensuring that we reflected on our progress and continuously improved our process.
Working closely with the Product Architect, I gained insights into the technical aspects of the project, which enabled me to guide the team in creating effective test cases and a solid testing strategy. I ensured that technical debt was actively managed, and we focused on producing clean, scalable code.
Through consistent coaching and proactive planning, the team was able to build momentum, stay aligned, and maintain high standards. The app was successfully delivered on time, with high quality, meeting all the requirements set out by the stakeholders.
